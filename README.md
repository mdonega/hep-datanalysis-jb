# Statistical Methods and Analysis Techniques in Experimental Physics: the Jupyter Book 

These notes are part of the supporting material used for the ETHZ Master-level course:

**Statistical Methods and Analysis Techniques in Experimental Physics**

initially taught by Mauro Donegà, Christoph Grab, Christian Regenfüs at ETH-Zürich during various semesters.

The material reported in this notes is largely a *compilation of existing literature* and detailed references are given throughout the manuscript.

So why yet another collection of notes ? What we tried to do is to improve the presentation of the material, sometimes using a simpler language, recurring to several practical examples, and by using the format of a "jupyter book".

How to use these notes:


- as an online book: just jump to the chapter/section (left and right columns) you are interested in, or browse it sequentially using the arrows at the bottom of the page. You also have a useful search tool at the top left of the webpage;

- as a standard book: you can download the pdf of each chapter clicking the download icon;
- as an interactive/executable book: when you see the rocket icon on the top right of the page, you can click on it and run the section in binder. Otherwise you can download the corresponding ipynb and execute it as a standard jupyter-notebook. If you are not familiar with notebooks you can find a quick howto in the appendices.

This notes are to be considered permanently as work in progress. Whenever something interesting comes our way, we will add it to the book.

As usual, whenever you see any mistake or typo, please email them to mauro.donega_at_phys.ethz.ch

Enjoy learning!
